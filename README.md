## ✨ Core Ecosystem

### 🎓 For Students: The Learning Lab
*   **AI Syllabus Architect:** Instantly transforms raw syllabus PDFs/text into structured, multi-week study plans with curated YouTube resources and automated quizzes.
*   **Predictive Focus Monitor:** A smart Pomodoro timer that monitors behavioral cues. If a user repeatedly deletes text or stalls, the AI triggers a **Wellbeing Intervention**.
*   **The Feynman Board:** A mastery tool where students "teach" concepts to the AI. It evaluates simplicity, flags jargon, and identifies knowledge gaps.
*   **Live Tutor (Voice API):** Low-latency, real-time audio tutoring using the **Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio** model for a natural conversational experience.
*   **Snap & Solve:** Visual AI that solves handwritten math problems or explains complex scientific diagrams from a single photo.
*   **Career Compass:** Maps study performance and personal interests to future career paths with "Day in the Life" simulations.

### 🍎 For Teachers: The Command Center
*   **Smart Grader:** AI-powered rubric-based assessment. Paste student work for instant scoring, constructive feedback, and specific correction suggestions.
*   **Class Analytics:** Heatmaps of student mood trends, average focus hours, and "At-Risk" alerts for students struggling with specific concepts.

### 🏠 For Parents: The Insight Hub
*   **Proactive Oversight:** Monitor stress trends and upcoming exam schedules without intrusive tracking.
*   **Homework Helper:** Real-time visibility into deadlines and AI-assisted tutoring for late-night study sessions.
